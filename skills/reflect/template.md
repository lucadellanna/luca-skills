# Reflection output format

Customize this file to change how reflections are presented. The procedure in SKILL.md references sections below by name.

---

## Insight categories

For each, be specific — reference files, functions, errors, or decisions. Skip categories with nothing non-obvious.

- **What worked** — effective approaches, tools, or patterns, and why.
- **What didn't work** — missteps, dead ends, false assumptions, and what they reveal.
- **Patterns discovered** — codebase conventions, domain knowledge, recurring structures.
- **Anti-patterns encountered** — things to avoid, and why they were tempting.
- **Open questions** — things that remain unclear or unresolved.

---

## Action types

- **Add to CLAUDE.md** — a rule or convention worth persisting for this project.
- **Update a skill** — an existing skill should incorporate what was learned.
- **Create a new skill** — a repeatable pattern emerged that warrants its own skill.
- **Add to framework** — a cross-skill convention or principle (only when inside a skills framework repo).
- **Persist to memory** — a fact or preference worth remembering across sessions.
- **No action needed** — the insight is worth noting but requires no change.

## Presentation structure

When presenting a reflection:

1. **Timeline** (brief) — goal, key steps, decision points, pivots. Context for insights, not the deliverable.
2. **Insights** — grouped by category (see above). Numbered for reference.
3. **Proposed actions** — numbered, with type label and plain-language description of what would change.

## Saved reflection format

When saving to file, use this structure:

```
# Reflection — YYYY-MM-DD

## Summary
[1-2 sentence summary of what was reflected on]

## Timeline
[Brief reconstruction]

## Insights
[Grouped by category]

## Actions taken
[Which proposed actions were implemented, with outcome]

## Actions deferred
[Any actions the user chose to skip, for future reference]
```
