# luca-skills

A curated collection of AI skills you can install, customize, and keep improving over time — all through plain conversation.

Skills help Claude do specific tasks well: download financial reports, analyze documents, review writing, and more. You own your skills locally. You can customize them to fit how you work. And when improvements are available, you decide what to adopt — in your own words, at your own pace.

## Getting started

You need **Claude Desktop** (or Claude Code CLI). If you don't have it yet, download it from [claude.ai](https://claude.ai).

Once you have Claude ready, copy and paste this into a new conversation:

> Please read the installation instructions at https://github.com/lucadellanna/luca-skills/blob/main/INSTALLATION.md and help me install the skills I'd like.

Claude will walk you through the rest. You'll see a list of available skills, pick the ones you want, and Claude will set them up for you.

## What you can do

- **Use skills** by asking Claude naturally ("download Apple's earnings reports")
- **Customize** by telling Claude what you'd like to change ("focus more on revenue growth")
- **Update** by saying "update my skills" — Claude will show you what's new and let you choose
- **Undo** any update with "undo the last update"
